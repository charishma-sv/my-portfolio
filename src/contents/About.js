        <p>
          I love creating things - be it a DIY for home decor or developing a
          Web page.
          <br />
          <br /> My passion for web development started after looking at
          websites from a different perspective. I remember the first time I
          inspect the code behind a web page using Dev-tools. Later that day, I
          analyzed code for 20 web pages. Eventually, I saw myself enjoying
          building web pages.
          <br />
          <br /> I love responsive web design. Looking at the web design flinch
          or expand based on the device used is fascinating. I'm Skilled in
          HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Bootstrap and Git/Github - also eager to
          learn coming up technologies that integrate into web design.
